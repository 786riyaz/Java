* **for(initialization; condition; update)** – Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times or based on a condition.

## **2. while Loop**
* **while(condition)** – Repeats the block as long as the condition is true (condition checked before loop starts).

## **3. do-while Loop**
* **do { } while(condition);** – Executes the block at least once, then continues while the condition is true.

## **7. Labeled break/continue**
* **break label;** / **continue label;** – Controls outer loops in nested loop scenarios.
