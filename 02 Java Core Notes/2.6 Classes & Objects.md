### 6.1 Procedure-Oriented vs Object-Oriented Programming

**Procedure Oriented**

* Focus on functions
* Data is exposed
* Difficult to maintain

**Object Oriented**

* Focus on objects
* Data + behavior together
* Secure and reusable

---

### 6.2 Instance Variables and Methods

* Belong to an object
* Created when object is created

```java
class Student {
    int id;          // instance variable
    void display() { // instance method
        System.out.println(id);
    }
}
```

---

### 6.3 Declaring and Using Objects

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
s1.id = 101;
s1.display();
```

---

### 6.4 Class vs Object

| Class     | Object        |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Blueprint | Real instance |
| Logical   | Physical      |
| No memory | Takes memory  |

---

### 6.5 `this` and `static` Keyword

**this**

* Refers to current object

```java
this.id = id;
```

**static**

* Belongs to class
* Shared across objects

```java
static int count;
```

---

### 6.6 Constructors & Code Blocks

**Constructor**

* Same name as class
* Initializes object
* No return type

```java
class Student {
    Student() {
        System.out.println("Object Created");
    }
}
```

**Instance Block**

* Runs before constructor

---

### Programming Challenges 51–52

* Constructor usage
* Static vs instance confusion removal

---

### 6.7 Stack vs Heap Memory

**Stack**

* Stores method calls
* Fast
* LIFO

**Heap**

* Stores objects
* Larger memory
* Managed by GC

---

### 6.8 Primitive vs Reference Types

| Primitive    | Reference      |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Stores value | Stores address |
| int, char    | Object, array  |

---

### 6.9 Variable Scope

* Local
* Instance
* Static
* Block scope

---

### 6.10 Garbage Collection & finalize()

* Automatic memory cleanup
* Objects with no reference are destroyed

```java
System.gc();
```

> `finalize()` is deprecated in modern Java (important interview note)

---

### Practice Exercise (Chapter 6)

* Object creation
* Memory understanding
* Scope-based problems
