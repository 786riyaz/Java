### 9.2 Abstract Keyword (Continued) – (01:44)

* Abstract class:

  * Cannot be instantiated
  * Can have constructors
  * Can have variables

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}
```

---

### 9.3 Interfaces – (14:21)

* 100% abstraction (before Java 8)
* Supports multiple inheritance

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

Key points:

* Methods are `public abstract` by default
* Variables are `public static final`

---

### Programming Challenge 83–84 – (23:34)

* Interface implementation
* Abstract vs interface comparison

---

### 9.4 What is Polymorphism – (37:43)

**One name, many forms**

Types:

* Compile-time (Overloading)
* Run-time (Overriding)

---

### 9.5 References and Objects – (45:43)

```java
Parent p = new Child();
```

* Reference decides accessible methods
* Object decides method execution

---

### 9.6 Method / Constructor Overloading – (1:06:49)

Same method name, different parameters.

```java
int add(int a, int b) {}
double add(double a, double b) {}
```

---

### 9.7 `super` Keyword – (1:18:21)

* Access parent class members

```java
super.method();
super();
```

---

### 9.8 Method / Constructor Overriding – (1:24:53)

```java
@Override
void show() {}
```

Rules:

* Same signature
* IS-A relationship
* Cannot reduce visibility

---

### 9.9 `final` Keyword Revisited – (1:38:19)

* `final` class → cannot extend
* `final` method → cannot override
* `final` variable → constant

---

### 9.10 Pass by Value vs Reference – (1:42:25)

* Java is **pass by value**
* Object reference value is passed

---

### Programming Challenge 85–86

### Practice Exercise (Chapter 9)

* Polymorphism mastery
* Overriding vs overloading clarity
