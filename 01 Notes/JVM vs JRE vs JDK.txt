The terms **JDK**, **JRE**, and **JVM** are closely related components of the Java platform, but they serve distinct purposes. The differences are best understood by looking at their roles and how they fit together.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

**What it is**
The **JVM** is an abstract machine responsible for **executing Java bytecode**.

**Key responsibilities**

* Loads `.class` files (bytecode)
* Verifies bytecode for security
* Converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions
* Manages memory (Heap, Stack, Garbage Collection)
* Ensures platform independence (“Write Once, Run Anywhere”)

**Important points**

* JVM does **not** understand Java source code (`.java`)
* Different operating systems have different JVM implementations
* JVM is included inside the JRE

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

![Image](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3461/images/nancb1.eps.gif)

**What it is**
The **JRE** provides everything required to **run** a Java application.

**Contains**

* JVM
* Core Java class libraries (e.g., `java.lang`, `java.util`)
* Supporting runtime files

**Use case**

* Ideal for **end users** who only need to run Java programs
* Cannot compile Java source code

**Important points**

* JRE = JVM + Libraries
* No development tools like `javac`

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

**What it is**
The **JDK** is a full-featured kit for **developing, compiling, debugging, and running** Java applications.

**Contains**

* JRE (and hence JVM)
* Development tools:

  * `javac` (compiler)
  * `java` (launcher)
  * `javadoc`
  * `jar`
  * Debugging and monitoring tools

**Use case**

* Required for **Java developers**
* Can both compile and run Java programs

## Comparison Table

| Aspect                     | JVM            | JRE       | JDK        |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Executes bytecode          | Yes            | Yes       | Yes        |
| Runs Java programs         | Yes            | Yes       | Yes        |
| Compiles Java code         | No             | No        | Yes        |
| Includes development tools | No             | No        | Yes        |
| Intended for               | Runtime engine | End users | Developers |

## Simple Analogy

* **JVM** → Engine of a car
* **JRE** → Car (engine + basic components to drive)
* **JDK** → Car factory (tools to build and test the car)

If you want, I can also provide:

* A one-line interview-ready explanation
* A memory trick for quick recall
* A real-world example using `.java` → `.class` → execution flow
